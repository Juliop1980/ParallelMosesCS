# Parallel Moses for Computer Science

Project to search for modules in the Modultransfersystem (MTS) of TU Berlin by matching words in the module description.

## Parallel Moses for Computer Science
Modultransfersystem (MTS) is a system of the Technical University of Berlin (https://moseskonto.tu-berlin.de/moses/modultransfersystem/index.html) that lets you look for modules according to different filters, such as the name of the module, to which degree it is assigned, and so on. The problem is that the names of the modules are, more often than not, not descriptive enough to make a decision about taking the module. This is especially true in computer science. This project intends to add this feature to make it easier for students in the master of computer science to look for specific content. One example for the kind of challenges this project aims to resolve is the module called "Software Security for Autonomous Systems" in which one of the topics is object-oriented software development, but a student interested in learning this would have to open the module description page and then see if this is one of the topics covered.
